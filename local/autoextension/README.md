This plugin extends the student expiration date upon a tutor providing feedback for their assignment.

Summary: This plugin extends the student expiration date by +2 weeks upon a tutor providing feedback for their assignment. The primary function of this plugin is to ensure the students can access their course and resubmit their assignments after feedback is provided by a tutor. Usually students who submit their final assignments such as electrical schematics or design tasks expire shortly after, so this plugin should provide then an additional 2 weeks from the date of tutor feedback.
